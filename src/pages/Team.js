I am deeply committed to my work as a teacher, and leveraging my position to help the field of wildlife biology become more inclusive and equitable.",

Since graduating, I have been lucky to work as a field scientist and environmental educator in some of the most beautiful places around the world like Mongolia, Yellowstone, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Sierra Nevada, and the White Mountains. I have worked with many different taxa, but birds stole my heart after my first field job studying red-headed woodpeckers. I am very excited to return to the wild world of woodpeckers with Drs. Frank Fogarty and Ho Yi Wan studying Lewisâ€™s Woodpecker migration and behavioral ecology in central Oregon.",

My project looked at understanding microclimate factors influencing changes in bird biomass and species richness during the breeding season in the HJ Andrews Experimental forest. The degree to which microclimate influences bird biomass and species richness remains largely unexplored which piqued my interest in this project. I was able to gain, feedback, advice, and valuable insights via Frank and grad students on my project. I was also able to learn more about what it takes to do a scientific project by listening to lab discussions about models, presentations, and articles.",
